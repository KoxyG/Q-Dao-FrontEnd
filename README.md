## Q-DAO-Backend


# Description

This repository contains the smart contracts and testing scripts for our decentralized application built on the Q blockchain. The project consists of three main contracts: QRC20 Token, AirDropV1, and AirDropV2.

# Contracts

**1. QRC20 Token**
The QRC20 Token contract (QRC20Token.sol) is responsible for deploying and managing our custom token on the Q blockchain. Users can use this token for various purposes within the MetaSchool ecosystem.

**2. AirDropV1**
The AirDropV1 contract (AirDropV1.sol) implements a merkle tree-based airdrop mechanism. It is designed to efficiently distribute rewards to users based on a predefined merkle root. This contract has been successfully deployed on the Q blockchain.

**3. AirDropV2**
The AirDropV2 contract (AirDropV2.sol) is responsible for creating campaigns and allowing users to claim rewards. It introduces an enhanced functionality compared to AirDropV1 and has been deployed on the Q blockchain.
